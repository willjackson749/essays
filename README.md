<p><i>OTHELLO</i> Lend me thy handkerchief.</p>
<em>DESDEMONA</em>  Here, my lord.</br>
*OTHELLO* That which I gave you.</br>
*DESDEMONA*  I have it not about me.</br>
*OTHELLO*  Not?</br>
*DESDEMONA*  No, faith, my lord.</br>
<p><i>OTHELLO</i>  That’s a fault. That handkerchief</br>
Did an Egyptian to my mother give.</br>
She was a charmer, and could almost read</br>
The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept</br>

’Twould make her amiable and subdue my father</br>
Entirely to her love. But if she lost it,</br>
Or made a gift of it, my father’s eye</br>
Should hold her loathèd, and his spirits should hunt</br>
After new fancies. She, dying, gave it me,</br>
And bid me, when my fate would have me wived,</br>
To give it her. I did so; and take heed on ’t,</br>
Make it a darling like your precious eye.</br>
To lose ’t or give ’t away were such perdition</br>
As nothing else could match</br>
*DESDEMONA*  Is ’t possible?</br>
*OTHELLO* ’Tis true. There’s magic in the web of it.</br>
A sybil that had numbered in the world</br>
The sun to course two hundred compasses,</br>
In her prophetic fury sewed the work.</br>
The worms were hallowed that did breed the silk,</br>
And it was dyed in ==mummy=={Q43616}, which the skillful</br>
Conserved of maidens’ hearts.</br>
*DESDEMONA*  I’ faith, is ’t true?</br>
*OTHELLO* Most veritable. Therefore, look to ’t well.</br>

*DESDEMONA* Then would to God that I had never seen ’t!</br>
*OTHELLO*  Ha? Wherefore?</br>
*DESDEMONA* Why do you speak so startingly and rash?</br>
*OTHELLO* Is ’t lost? Is ’t gone? Speak, is ’t out o’ th’ way?</br>
*DESDEMONA*  Heaven bless us!</br>
*OTHELLO*  Say you?</br>
*DESDEMONA* It is not lost, but what an if it were?</br>
*OTHELLO*  How?</br>
*DESDEMONA*  I say it is not lost.</br>
*OTHELLO*  Fetch ’t. Let me see ’t!</br>
*DESDEMONA* Why, so I can. But I will not now.</br>
This is a trick to put me from my suit.</br>
Pray you, let ==Cassio=={Q6829164} be received again.</br>
*OTHELLO* Fetch me the handkerchief! Aside. My mind</br>
misgives.</br>
*DESDEMONA*  Come, come.</br>
You’ll never meet a more sufficient man.</br>
*OTHELLO* The handkerchief!</br>
